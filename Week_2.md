## Design Process 

## 1. You are asked to design a system to support the social workers in a non-profit focused on helping low-income families, but you know very little about this context. What is the most important question to answer with formative work before beginning to design?

(correct) Who are the target users, in terms of their challenges, strategies, and values?
How technically literate are your users?
What technology do the users say they want?
Do these users tend to use iOS or Android products?

## 2. You are trying to design a system to support social workers in scheduling home visits with low-income families and have a fairly good idea about this context and users from your previous formative work. What is the most important question to answer before committing to specific technology solution?

What is the best visual design for your interface?
When do the users get confused or make errors with each of your proposed solutions?
(correct) What are the key challenges your solutions must address and key constraints to which it must adhere?
Who are your target users?

## 3. Which of the following is true about “critique” as a design-centered approach? (Select all that apply)

() A critique is a structured discussion of design ideas with a team of experts.
It is an important component of intellectual rigor in design-centered approaches.
A critique-driven discussion assumes that the participants are trained experts who have developed good intuitions through years of work.
() A critique involves asking users to use and provide feedback on your interface.

# 4.Which of the following best describes the “Cultural Probes” design method when done correctly?

() The probes will tell you what to build next.
Cultural probes must always include a camera, a recorder, and a notebook.
The probes focus on initiating a rich dialogue, inspiring, and challenging assumptions.
The probes are sufficient to gather data without specific prompts.

# 5.Which of the following statements are true about the “Participatory Design” method when it is done correctly? (Select all that apply)

() Participatory design is best described as a process where an interdisciplinary team (e.g., designer, programmers, and business person) participate together in creating a good system for users.
The primary role of users in a participatory design process is as sources for formative data for the design team.
() Design partners should be included at multiple stages of the process: formative work, design, and evaluation.
In participatory design, ideas from users should be interpreted and implemented literally, because users have the best understanding of their context.

# 6.Which of the following statements  is true about “Value Sensitive Design” (VSD) when done correctly?

() VSD is best applied as a way to evaluate a final design once it is implemented, in order to understand whether that solution matches the values of the intended users.
In VSD, the designer must use the specific methods of contextual inquiry and envisioning cards to consider values.
VSD focuses on practical values that deal with getting tasks done quickly, such as efficiency and collaboration.
VSD supports the designer in considering how technical systems may support or violate human values.

# 7.You are a novice designer tasked with creating a web-based user interface for course registration at a university. College students using the system generally already know which courses they want to take and will want to complete the registration task quickly and efficiently. Which of the following approaches is most reasonable and why?

A design-centered approach, because it is the approach best suited to structured tasks and this approach provides a lot of structure for novice designers.
(correct) A task-centered user interface design (TCUID) approach, because this problem can be described as a series of tasks and TCUID provides a clear set of steps and artifacts for creating a reasonable task-centered interface.
A task-centered user interface design (TCUID) approach, because it is the only valid and rigorous approach to user-interface design.
A design-centered approach, because this is a case where motivation, affect, and values are most important to this system’s success.

# 8.Which of the following statements accurately describe personas?

They are based on research
() Each product or interface needs exactly one persona
Each persona describes an individual who was studied in the research
() They are used as part of the design process

# 9.In the case study on improving an existing solution, we heard about why the MovieLens system interface was updated.  Three of the following were reasons for making these updates -- which one was not a reason?

The new user experience was too complex
Users complained that the interface felt dated
(correct) The old interface took too much CPU time
Many of the prominent interface features were not being used  

# 10.All of the design processes we discuss have three core elements.  Which of the following is not one of those core elements?

User Research
(correct) Formal Specification
Design and Prototyping
Evaluation

# 11.Usability engineering has a focus on iteratively designing, evaluating, and re-designing.  What is the insight behind this process?

() That there is a limit to how much design you can do before the design starts getting worse.
That user interface design has to be iterative because users make use of the interfaces over and over again.
That it is easier to improve an interface design than to get it right the first time
That designers and developers get bored if they work too long without switching to another task.

# 12.Which of the following artifacts is this: “John’s boss tells him about a new course on user interface design on Coursera, offered by a team of faculty at the University of Minnesota.  She asks him to look into the course and find out how long it would take to complete and whether John has the background needed to take it.”
(wrong) A persona
A task description
A walkthrough scenario
None of the above
