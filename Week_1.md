## Intro to UI Design: Introduction and Overview Assesment 1

# 1.
The video that introduced the idea of Hall of Fame and Hall of Shame interfaces included a few pieces of design wisdom. Which of the following are true? (Select all that apply)
 # Written instructions in any user interface are a sign of bad design.
  Simple things should be simple to use.
 # Responding to a user’s action with multiple types of subtle visual feedback is a good design strategy.
  The design principle of Visibility is relevant for both computer interfaces and physical objects.

Question 2
Suppose you are re-designing an application, and you have access to usage data from the current application that shows a particular command is not used frequently.  Which of the following responses or actions is best supported by this usage data?
Remove the command from the application. It will simplify the application and make it easy to learn.
Create a keyboard shortcut for the command so that anyone who does want to use it can do so quickly and easily.
# Do not include a button for this item in the main menu bar -- it’s not worth devoting lots of space to an infrequently used option.
Come up with a new and more appealing name for the command so users will use the command more frequently.

Question 3
Suppose you are designing a book search feature for children. What is one relevant lesson learned from the International Children’s Digital Library project?
Make sure to include cartoon characters to engage the child.
# (wrong) Children may want to search for a book based on its length, its characters, or the color of its cover
Children typically search for books by typing in the name of the author or the title.
You may assume that a knowledgeable adult will be helping the child with your interface.

Question 4
Suppose you are designing a socio-technical system (i.e., a social system operating on a technical base). What are relevant lessons learned from Airbnb and Couchsurfing?  Please select all answers that apply.
People always want to see other users’ personal information like their age and gender in a socio-technical system.
Make sure to include price information on the landing page.
# (wrong) Good design should reflect and reinforce the purpose of the system. 
# (wrong) Although both Airbnb and Couchsurfing provide beds for travelers, the interface of Airbnb reinforces the idea that Airbnb is a platform for people to find place to stay over; while couchsurfing successfully builds an environment where people find other people to stay with.

Question 5
User interface design draws from many disciplines. Which of the following triples best reflects the core disciplines that UI Design draws from?
Computer Graphics (e.g., rendering and visualization); Computer Networking (e.g,, Internet protocols); and Computer Algorithms (e.g., complexity)
# Design (e.g., industrial design); Technology (e.g., computer science); and Understanding Humans (e.g., psychology)
Statistics; Signal Processing; and Machine Learning
Technology (e.g., computer science); Ethics (e.g., philosophy); and Economics (e.g., supply/demand)

Question 6
What UI Design principle was illustrated by the case study that examined the death of an elderly person routed to a dangerous favela in Brazil?
Never allow a user to travel into a dangerous neighborhood.
Make sure in-car interfaces can be operated without requiring the driver’s hands or visual attention.  
Prevent errors by eliminating error-prone conditions or checking for them and requiring users to confirm before committing.
# Always be sure all of the options in your interface have visible controls.

Question 7
Which of these lessons (drawn from the TurboTax and StubHub case studies) best reflects an opportunity for successful user interface design?
# Find processes people find hard or painful and make them easier.
Any activity involving money can be made better with a web-based interface.
People generally trust computers with their personal financial data like taxes or credit cards.
Users are delightfully surprised if you hide data and reveal it at the end (e.g., tax refund or ticket fees).

8.
Question 8
Why do we focus on case studies and hall of fame/hall of shame examples?
# (wrong) Looking at good and bad interfaces is a way of learning about users, which we know is an important part of UI Design.
It makes us feel better to see that others design badly, and inspires us when others design well.
The last key part of UI Design is evaluation, and it works just as well to evaluate others’ interfaces as to evaluate your own.  
If we notice good and bad designs and reason about what makes them good or bad, we can learn principles about design that can help us design better interfaces ourselves.

Question 9
Anton Yelchin (the Star Trek actor) died in an accident that has beenattributed to a poor gear shift design.  What was the problem and how could it have been avoided.
The gear shift didn’t have a park setting; the carmaker should have included one rather than relying on the user turning off the car.
The gear shift moved between forward and reverse to easily, killing the engine; the carmaker could have put in an interlock.
# The gear shift worked differently from usual and didn’t physically reflect the current gear; the carmaker could have used existing standard interfaces.
The gear shift didn’t actually work; a warning light should have indicated it was broken

Question 10
In the case study looking at the Citibank ATM design, what conclusion could you draw about the banks that had deployed ATMs that caused customers to stop using them by eating their cards:
# They didn’t understand how to take the fact that people came in upset about eaten cards and use that to change the design of the ATMs to fix the problem.  
The bank employees were just like their customers and therefore completely understood how their customers felt.
They never realized that people had problems with the ATMs.
They deliberately wanted customers to be unhappy since using ATMs cost the banks too much money.
